I regularly develop browser extensions for personal use. Of those, the
majority introduce aesthetic or quality-of-life enhancements for
specific websites that make use of extensive DOM manipulation and
stylesheet injections&mdash;while it is entirely possible to
accomplish this with a combination of userscript and stylesheet
managers (I favor [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)
and [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus)), any one site
might require a suite of many interdependent scripts and themes to be
installed and configured separately. Refactoring these into an
extension can make sense.

I've tried for a while now to nail down a stack and workflow to
implement the base functionality I want (that is, programmatic
stylesheet injections). I'm looking for it to support the following:

1. _Firefox and Chrome._ I don't use Chromium-based browsers anymore,
   but supporting the former generally entails supporting the latter. I
   have used [CRXJS](https://crxjs.dev/vite-plugin) to this end before,
   but it relies on Chrome's API for hot reload and is therefore out of
   the running.

2. _Modern frameworks, TypeScript, and CSS preprocessing._ I use SCSS,
   mostly, because I find that indented syntax sometimes interferes with
   your formatter. I haven't written vanilla JavaScript or CSS since
   middle school and I do not intend to start now.

3. _Hot module reload._ Specifically, the stylesheets must be watched
   as part of the dependency graph, but they should not be content
   scripts in and of themselves.

No tool presently offers a pipeline for (3) out of the box. After
trying something like ten different build tools and wrangling together
my own with Bun, I begrudgingly acknowledge that
[WXT](https://wxt.dev/) is the most comprehensive offering
available. It's also in pre-release and has all of the bugs to show
for it.

_Edit (2025-07)._ I've made some changes to this implementation, and
it is now much more stable than it was previously (I used to rely on a
patched version of WXT to make an `injection.scss`
entrypoint). I consider this iteration largely production-ready.

## Getting started with WXT

We can bootstrap the project relatively easily. I use Svelte and Bun,
but the frontend framework you use is immaterial for content
scripting.

```sh
bunx wxt@latest init
```

I'll also install my preferred preprocessor now:

```sh
bun add -D sass-embedded # or sass
```

The base stylesheet we attempt to inject can contain any rule for
testing purposes. As we should be able to leverage all typical SASS
features, I'll create a file that imports a partial with the `@use`
rule:

```scss
// src/lib/injection.scss

@use '../assets/styles/_variables';

body {
  background: variables.$color;
}
```

Let's then create the partial that we specified above, along with its
corresponding variable declarations:

```scss
// src/assets/styles/_variables.scss

$color: blue;
```

I would not place the `injection.scss` file in any directory where it
would automatically be bundled, like `src/entrypoints` or
`src/assets`. If you do, the process to get this to work is much more
fragile and complex than I'd like, and you'll have to fight most of
WXT's defaults by hijacking its build process and patching the package
and performing all manner of messy interventions.

What this means, then, is that we will be eschewing the conventional
approach which involves specifying standalone CSS files as
web-accessible resources. Instead, we can exploit a Vite feature that
will allow us to import our styles _inline_ and programmatically run
the injection from there. We can encapsulate the logic we need in a
standard TypeScript module&mdash;not an unlisted script, which would
be as difficult to hot-reload as an unlisted stylesheet&mdash;that WXT
will incorporate into the content script at build time.

Let's write that injection script:

```ts
// src/lib/injection.ts

import css from './injection.scss?inline'

const injectionMap = new Map<string, HTMLStyleElement>()
const key = './injection.scss'

export default function injectStyle() {
  let style = injectionMap.get(key)

  if (!style) {
    style = document.createElement('style')
    style.setAttribute('data-extension-style', key)
    injectionMap.set(key, style)

    const append = () => document.head!.appendChild(style)

    document.head
      ? append()
      : new MutationObserver((_, obs) => {
        if (document.head) {
          obs.disconnect();
          append();
        }
      }).observe(document.documentElement, { childList: true, subtree: true })
    }

    style.textContent = css
  }
}
```

This is a straightforward set of instructions to create a `<style>`
element and fill it with our compiled SCSS. Other enhancements:

- We track a reference to the `<style>` element in our `injectionMap`
  with some identifier which I've hard-coded&mdash;this isn't a
  particularly useful structure now, but it will accommodate more
  stylesheets should we want them later. Because this function re-runs
  upon hot reload, this will allow us to avoid injecting the same
  styles multiple times.
- The `MutationObserver` instance emulates the behavior of a CSS
  content script with the option `"runAt": "document_start"` in the
  manifest. We set it to listen for the `<head>` element to load in,
  which will generally trigger a few moments before the
  `DOMContentLoaded` event. This avoids the short delay that we would
  otherwise observe between the initial paint and the application of
  the stylesheet.

Let's go to the content script. WXT requires that you declare the
script and its various properties (that is, the ones you would
ordinarily specify in the manifest) within a `defineContentScript()`
function.

You can reference more of the options that it accepts
[here](https://wxt.dev/api/reference/wxt/type-aliases/ContentScriptDefinition.html#type-alias-contentscriptdefinition).
The injection goes in the `main()` function, which will run when our
route's domain matches `google.com`. For now, we can import and call
the function we defined earlier:

```ts
// src/entrypoints/content.ts

import injectStyle from '../lib/injection'

export default defineContentScript({
  matches: ['*://*.google.com/*'],
  run_at: 'document_start',
  main() {
    injectStyle()
  },
})
```

Finally, I test out hot reload by running the following:

```sh
bun run dev:firefox
```

Direct changes to `src/lib/injection.scss` should force the extension
to reload immediately. If you write to the partials we declared in the
directory `src/styles/`, you may have to give the injection file a
prod to see changes propagate. Otherwise, it should be working as
expected.

## More modular injections

This project is adequate as is for individual injections, but what
if&mdash;a fairly typical use case&mdash;we would like to run multiple
at once according to user flags we save in browser storage? We'll need
to restructure the project somewhat. I want each tweak to have its own
directory within `src/lib/`, like so:

```
lib/
├── tweaks/
│   ├── darkMode/
│   │   ├── index.ts
│   │   └── injection.scss
│   └── test/
│       ├── index.ts
│       └── injection.scss
```

Here, I've placed our `injection.scss` and `.ts` files into the
`darkMode/` folder, and I've created some other within the directory
`test/`. The implementation doesn't matter much. We can reuse the same
code in `darkMode/index.ts` that we wrote earlier to inject the
stylesheet in `test/`, so let's refactor that into its own global
utility:

```ts
// src/lib/utils/inject-style.ts

const injectionMap = new Map<string, HTMLStyleElement>()

export function injectStyle(css: string, key: string): void {
  let style = injectionMap.get(key)

  if (!style) {
    style = document.createElement('style')
    style.setAttribute('data-extension-style', key)
    injectionMap.set(key, style)

    const append = () => document.head!.appendChild(style!)

    document.head
      ? append()
      : new MutationObserver((_, obs) => {
          if (document.head) {
            obs.disconnect()
            append()
          }
        }).observe(document.documentElement, { childList: true, subtree: true })
  }

  style.textContent = css
}
```

We can call it wherever needed, like so:

```ts
// src/lib/tweaks/darkMode/index.ts

import { injectStyle } from '@/lib/utils/inject-style'

export default function darkMode() {
  injectStyle(styles, 'darkMode/injection.scss')
}
```

I won't implement a full interface that allows users to define their
local preferences, but I'll assume for simplicity's sake that we have
some logic in our extension popup that saves them as boolean flags. We
can write a function that allows us to fetch those preferences using
the browser API:

```ts
// src/lib/utils/settings.ts

export async function getUserSettings(): Promise<Record<string, boolean>> {
  const result = await browser.storage.local.get()
  return result as Record<string, boolean>
}
```

In a new `src/lib/tweaks/index.ts` file, we can aggregate arbitrarily
defined tweaks, so long as they're placed in their own directories and
export some default function to be called by the content script. This
uses `import.meta.glob` functionality from Vite (which underlies WXT).

```ts
// src/lib/tweaks/index.ts

export type Tweak = () => void

const modules = import.meta.glob<{ default: Tweak }>('./*/index.ts', {
  eager: true,
})

export const tweaks: Record<string, Tweak> = Object.fromEntries(
  Object.entries(modules).map(([path, mod]) => [
    path.match(/\.\/([^/]+)\//)![1], // e.g. "darkMode"
    mod.default,
  ]),
)
```

Finally, I modify the content script so that it takes a look at our
user settings and calls the corresponding functions according to which
ones are flagged as `true`:

```ts
// src/entrypoints/content.ts

import { tweaks } from '@/lib/tweaks'
import { getUserSettings } from '@/lib/utils/settings'

export default defineContentScript({
  matches: ['*://*.google.com/*'],
  cssInjectionMode: 'manual',
  runAt: 'document_start',
  async main() {
    const settings = await getUserSettings() // e.g., { darkMode: true, test: false }

    for (const [name, tweak] of Object.entries(tweaks))
      if (settings[name]) tweak()
  },
})
```

We're good to go on this front.
