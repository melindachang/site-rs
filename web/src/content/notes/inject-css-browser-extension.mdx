I regularly develop browser extensions for personal use. Of those, the
majority make aesthetic or quality-of-life enhancements for specific
websites that at once require extensive DOM manipulation and
stylesheet injections&mdash;while it is entirely possible to
accomplish this with a combination of userscript and stylesheet
managers (I favor [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)
and [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus)), any one site
might require a suite of many interdependent scripts and themes to be
installed and configured separately. Refactoring these into an
extension can make sense.

I've tried for a while now to nail down a stack and workflow to
implement the base functionality I want (that is, programmatic
stylesheet injections). For my sanity, it must support the following:

1. _Firefox and Chrome._ I don't use Chromium-based browsers anymore,
   but supporting the former generally entails supporting the latter.
   [CRXJS](https://crxjs.dev/vite-plugin) relies on Chrome's API for hot
   reload and is therefore out of the running.

2. _Modern frameworks, TypeScript, and CSS preprocessing._ I use SCSS,
   mostly. I haven't had to write vanilla JavaScript or CSS since middle
   school and I do not intend to start now.

3. _Hot module reload._ Specifically, the stylesheets must be watched
   as part of the dependency graph, but they should not be content
   scripts in and of themselves.

No tool presently offers a pipeline for (3) out of the box. After
trying something like ten different build tools and wrangling together
my own with Bun, I begrudgingly accept that [WXT](https://wxt.dev/) is
the most comprehensive offering available. It is also in pre-release
and has all of the bugs to show for it.

_Edit (July 2025)._ I've made some changes to this implementation, and
it is now much more stable than it was previously (I used to rely on a
patched version of WXT to make an `injection.scss`
entrypoint). Regardless, I would remain cautious about using most of
this code in production. More on this later.

## Getting started with WXT

We can bootstrap the project relatively easily. I use Svelte and Bun,
but the frontend framework you use is immaterial for content
scripting.

```sh
bunx wxt@latest init
```

The base stylesheet we attempt to inject can contain any rule for
testing purposes. As we should be able to leverage all typical SASS
features, I'll create a file that imports a partial with the `@use`
rule:

```scss
// src/lib/injection.scss

@use '../assets/styles/_variables';

body {
  background: variables.$color;
}
```

Let's then create the partial that we specified above, along with its
corresponding variable declarations:

```scss
// src/assets/styles/_variables.scss

$color: blue;
```

I would not place the `injection.scss` file in any directory where it
would automatically be bundled, like `src/entrypoints` or
`src/assets`. The process to make this work is much more fragile and
complex than I'd like, and you wind up fighting most of WXT's defaults
by hijacking its build process and patching the package and performing
all manner of other messy interventions.

What this means, then, is that we will be eschewing the conventional
approach which involves specifying standalone CSS files as
web-accessible resources. Instead, we exploit a Vite feature that
will allow us to import our styles _inline_ and programmatically run
the injection from there. We can encapsulate the logic we need in a
standard TypeScript module&mdash;not an unlisted script, which would
be as difficult to hot-reload as an unlisted stylesheet&mdash;that WXT
will incorporate into the content script at build time. `content.ts`
is an entrypoint by default and so is added to the dependency graph
automatically.

Let's go to the content script. WXT requires that you declare the
script and its various properties (that is, the ones you would
ordinarily specify in the manifest) within a `defineContentScript()`
function. The default template will include something like this:

```ts
// src/entrypoints/content.ts

export default defineContentScript({
  matches: ['*://*.google.com/*'],
  main() {
    console.log('Hello content.')
  },
})
```

You can reference more of the options that it accepts
[here](https://wxt.dev/api/reference/wxt/type-aliases/ContentScriptDefinition.html#type-alias-contentscriptdefinition).
The injection goes in the `main()` function, which will run when our
route's domain matches `google.com`. Let's define a function that
creates a DOM node that links to our style resource.

```ts
// src/entrypoints/content.ts

const inject_style_and_repaint = (): void => {
  const href = browser.runtime.getURL('assets/injection.css')

  const prev = document.querySelector('link[data-extension-style]')
  if (prev) prev.remove()

  const link = document.createElement('link')
  link.rel = 'stylesheet'
  link.href = href
  link.dataset.extensionStyle = href

  const parent = document.head ?? document.documentElement
  parent.appendChild(link)
}

export default defineContentScript({
  // ...
})
```

Next, we write our logic in the `main()` function, which will simply
call the function `inject_style_and_repaint()` on document load.

```ts
// src/entrypoints/content.ts

//...
export default defineContentScript({
  matches: ['*://*.google.com/*'],
  main() {
    if (
      document.head ||
      document.readyState === 'complete' ||
      document.readyState === 'interactive'
    ) {
      inject_style_and_repaint()
    } else {
      window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', inject_style_and_repaint, {
        once: true,
      })
    }
  },
})
```

## Bundle configuration

WXT is based off of Vite, so we don't need to include any additional
configuration in order for our stylesheet to be pre-processed:

```sh
bun add -D sass-embedded
```

WXT generates our manifest at build time according to the target
(Chrome or Firefox) that we specify, but we want to explicitly
hard-code our stylesheet as a web-accessible resource so that we can
retrieve it via `browser.runtime.getURL()`. We can define these
options in the WXT config at the base of our project directory:

```ts
// wxt.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'wxt'

export default defineConfig({
  srcDir: 'src',
  modules: ['@wxt-dev/module-svelte'],
  manifest: {
    web_accessible_resources: [
      { matches: ['*://*.google.com/*'], resources: ['assets/injection.css'] },
    ],
  },
})
```

If we build for a Firefox target, which supports manifest V2, WXT will
make the conversion automatically.

## Enabling hot repaint

The basic injection functionality will work without any further
intervention. I can run the development server with my preferred
browser target:

```shellscript
bun run dev:firefox
```

After navigating to a URL under the matching domain (that is,
`google.com`) search engine has changed to the color we
specified&mdash;in my case, blue&mdash;in
`src/assets/styles/_variables.scss`.

By default, neither the unlisted styles included in the bundle via
`src/entrypoints` nor the SASS dependencies they `@use` or `@forward`
are included in the dependency graph. WXT exposes a somewhat limited
API that allows us to rectify this behavior at build time via modules.

Any script we include in the `modules/` folder WXT will automatically
try to include. Let's make it:

```ts
// modules/scss-deps-hmr.ts

import { defineWxtModule } from 'wxt/modules'
import path from 'path'
import fs from 'fs'

export default defineWxtModule({
  setup(wxt) {
    wxt.hook('server:started', (wxt, server) => {
      const injection = path.resolve(
        wxt.config.root,
        'src/entrypoints/injection.scss',
      )
      const themes_dir = path.resolve(wxt.config.root, 'src/lib/themes')
      server.watcher.add(themes_dir)
      server.watcher.on('change', async file => {
        if (file.endsWith('.scss')) {
          console.log(
            '[scss-hmr] Invalidating module: ',
            path.relative(wxt.config.root, injection),
          )

          await wxt.builder.build({
            type: 'unlisted-style',
            name: 'injection',
            options: {},
            inputPath: injection,
            outputDir: path.resolve(wxt.config.outDir, 'assets'),
          })

          server.reloadExtension()
        }
      })
    })
  },
})
```

A quick walkthrough of what this accomplishes:

- WXT exposes a number of build events that we can hook into to
  perform modifications; in our case, we wait for the development
  server to initialize.
- WXT uses Vite uses the Chokidar file watcher under the hood. Our
  base injection file is included in the watchlist by virtue of being
  in `src/entrypoints`, but not the modules it imports. I've
  inelegantly hard-coded a directory in which all of them live that
  the watcher will search, because I doubt it's possible to step
  through specific chains of dependency between SASS files without
  writing a Vite plugin.
- We add an event listener that invalidates `injection.scss` if any
  watched `.scss` file is written to. As we need preprocessors to
  fire, this means sending it through the WXT builder. We need,
  finally, to reload the entire extension (not a terribly expensive
  operation) to get the content script to run again without a refresh.

HMR for our unlisted stylesheet is now functional. Try making an edit
to it, though, and you may notice some peculiar behavior. I'll declare
the variable as something else:

```scss
// src/lib/styles/_variables.scss

$color: red;
```

We should see in DevTools that the style resource has hot-reloaded
accordingly; it will show up correctly if you navigate again to the
URL in `<link>`. But the changes do not show up on the screen unless
we manually tick the box next to our applied style with Inspect
Element, and our changes disappear even then upon a refresh.

This is because the new `<link>` element that we've created points to
the same URL as the one we delete with `node.remove()` each time the
extension reloads. Firefox caches this asset and does not re-read
its contents.

As a solution, we can add a unique tag to the end of each URL that
forces the hot reload during development:

```ts
// src/entrypoints/content.ts

const inject_style_and_repaint = (): void => {
  const href = browser.runtime.getURL('content-scripts/content.css')
  const href =
    browser.runtime.getURL('content-scripts/content.css') + `?t=${Date.now()}`
  // ...
}
```

We never read this option ourselves, but Firefox registers it as a URL
that differs from the one stored in cache and will trigger the
repaint. This leaves us with a complete content script that looks like
this:

```ts
// src/entrypoints/content.ts
import '../assets/injection.scss'

const inject_style_and_repaint = (): void => {
  const href =
    browser.runtime.getURL('content-scripts/content.css') + `?t=${Date.now()}`

  const prev = document.querySelector('link[data-extension-style]')
  if (prev) prev.remove()

  const link = document.createElement('link')
  link.rel = 'stylesheet'
  link.href = href
  link.dataset.extensionStyle = href

  const parent = document.head ?? document.documentElement
  parent.appendChild(link)
}

export default defineContentScript({
  matches: ['*://*.google.com/*'],
  cssInjectionMode: 'manual',
  main() {
    if (
      document.head ||
      document.readyState === 'complete' ||
      document.readyState === 'interactive'
    ) {
      inject_style_and_repaint()
    } else {
      window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', inject_style_and_repaint, {
        once: true,
      })
    }
  },
})
```

And we're done.
