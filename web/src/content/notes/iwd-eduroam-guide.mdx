I have attempted by this point to install Arch Linux on campus Wi-Fi twice.
Unfortunately, the guest network is not an option, as I havenâ€™t been able to
get through web authentication with Lynx (the only browser included in the
installation medium).

That leaves eduroam and iwd. This is a Northwestern-specific guide, which I
mention because the network configuration profile varies somewhat by school.
Consider using either Ethernet or Wi-Fi tethering to save yourself some
inconvenience.
